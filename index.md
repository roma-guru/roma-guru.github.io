## Background
Hi, I'm  _Roma_. I live in _Saint-Petersburg_, Russia.
Don't consider me too serious calling myself a guru.
I'm just a software developer and researcher, who is capable of mostly learning and rarely teaching.

Also I'm a physicist by diploma and spirit.
That means I love repeatable experiments and structural decomposition of the things.
I'm keen on getting to the root of technical and social issues and processes.

## Values

- Clear, empathic communication in these all-remote times

## Goals 
What do I want to spend my life for?

## Projects and ideas
