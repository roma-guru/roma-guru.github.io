## About
Hi, my name is  _Roma_. And I still live in Russia, now Syberia.
Here is my [CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roma-guru/roma-guru.github.io/master/Roman_Voropaev.pdf).
Don't consider me too serious calling myself a guru. Originally that was just a domain for my homepage.
I'm just a software developer and researcher, who is capable of mostly learning and sometimes teaching.

Also I'm a physicist by diploma and spirit.
That means I love repeatable experiments and structural decomposition of the things.
I'm keen on getting to the root of technical and social issues and processes.
And I'd like to continue my personal life research, cause there are so many curious things...

## My values
- Openness
- Freedom
- Learning
- Respect
- Curiosity

## My expectations
What do I expect from the project team?
- Product that I can use myself and be proud to share with my friends
- Strong motivation to reach the production and maintain it passionately
- Predictable deadlines with probabilistic estimations
- CI & TDD, cause we are faulty humans (at least me)
- Research space, and openess to rapid changes without fear
- Clear, empathic communication in these all-remote times

## My goals
What do I want to spend my life for?
- Travel around the world on a boat through 4 oceans
- Make AI emotionally capable and respectfull
- Make humankind little bit kinder if I can
- and something more..

## My projects and ideas
I don't have facebook/instagram because it spoils our minds and souls.
I do have [github](https://github.com/roma-guru).
There you may find my contacts.
